## Website Link:

https://unstoppabledomains.com/



## What I find interesting about this website:



 I find unstoppable domains to be interesting because they are leading the move towards Web3. Instead of the traditional ".com" and  ".edu" domains, they are moving towards domains like ".crypto", ".x", ".coin", etc. These are interesting due to the fact that these domains are only a one time purchase and live on the Ethereum blockchain and are decentralized.   

 This will allow the internet to go back to its roots of activism and free speech, as people will not be able to easily censor these blockchain websites. While some people may say that this is dangerous, it is in fact going back to what the internet was intially intented to be used for. Free speech and the ability to voice ones opinion without the fear of being censored.

With the rise of decentralized blockchain technologies, most notably with cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular,
there is no doubt that the advent of Web3 will have a significant impact for everyone. unstoppabledomains seems to be
pioneering this movement via decentralized domains, which like you mentioned, will have big ramifications in terms of
free speech on the web. I look forward to see if decentralized domains will be adopted more widely in the future.
